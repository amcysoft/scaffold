# Laravel 5.2 Simple Scaffold Generator


Hi, this is a scaffold generator for Laravel 5.2 with bootstrap 3 template.



## Usage

### Step 1: Install Through Composer

```
composer require 'amcysoft/scaffold' --dev
```

### Step 2: Add the Service Provider

Open `config/app.php` and the following to your **providers** array, add:

```
"Amcysoft\Scaffold\ScaffoldServiceProvider"
```

### Step 3: Run Artisan!

You're now able to run artisan command. Run `php artisan` from the console, and you'll see the new commands `make:scaffold`.

## Examples


```
php artisan make:scaffold Article --schema="title:string description:text"
```
This command will generate:

```
database/migrations/2016_06_18_171537_create_articles_table.php
app/Http/Controllers/ArticlesController.php
app/Article.php
resources/views/articles/create.blade.php
resources/views/articles/edit.blade.php
resources/views/articles/form.blade.php
resources/views/articles/index.blade.php
resources/views/articles/show.blade.php
database/seeds/ArticlesTableSeeder.php
```

This scaffolding will automatically add route to **routes.php** file, run the **migration**, and *seeds* the data.

## Rollback Scaffold

You can also rollback your scaffolding by the following command.

```
php artisan remove:scaffold Article
```

This will reverse all the process generated by scaffold:make command.
